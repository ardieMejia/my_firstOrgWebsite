      <description>My new shiny website that really only stores my posts as exact copies of my org files  They are made this way so that thinking about my website design doesnt interfere the flow of thought when using Emacs   These are all generated from my org files    Which means literally all I have to do is type something like this:
*Heading1 :PROPERTIES: :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: somefilename :EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: directoryname :CUSTOM_ID: someID :END: ** Subheading1 - Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;#39;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</description>
